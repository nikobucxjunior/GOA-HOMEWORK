    <p class="description">Over the next three decades, the group diversified into areas including food processing, textiles,
    insurance, securities, and retail. Samsung entered the electronics industry in the late 1960s and the construction
    and shipbuilding industries in the mid-1970s; these areas would drive its subsequent growth. Following Lee's death in 1987,
    Samsung was separated into five business groups – Samsung Group, Shinsegae Group, CJ Group and Hansol Group, and JoongAng Group.</p>

    consumer electronics maker and chipmaker measured by 2017 revenues),[5][6] Samsung Heavy Industries
    (the world's second largest shipbuilder measured by 2010 revenues),[7] and Samsung Engineering and Samsung C&T Corporation
    (respectively the world's 13th and 36th largest construction companies).[8] Other notable subsidiaries include Samsung Life
